### Purpose of the Report

Pewlett Hackard (PH) is an old company with thousand of employees. This report is written to assist Bobby who works
as Data Analyst for PH. Main objective is prepare tables regarding the number of employees who are due for the Retirement
packages, and help Bobby in helping his manager face properly the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach
retirement age.

### Results

The list is long and it will be useful to count the retirement titles. The following table precisely gives such
information.

Senior Engineer is the largest group to retire. The total number of employees retiring is close to 90, 390
which is actually 18% of the current employees. This shows that this is really silver tsunami and PH has to prepare
well financially to support the retirement for such large number of employees.

2. The second important task is to prepare a table on mentorship for those  whose birth dates
 are between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. The following table gives this information.

 The information is given by the name of employees their birth_date, duration of employment and title.
 Total of 3,126 employees are ready for mentorship. This is also a large number. Careful planning is
 required to provide mentorship.

 3. ADDITIONAL QUERIES: Two additional queries were run. The first one was to create a table called salaries of retires.
 and the second one on salaries for those who are eligible for mentorship. As expected, the average salary
 those who are eligible for mentorship was lower ($52609) than the average for the salaries of retirees ($52988)
 but the difference is not significant.

 4. The biggest gap PH is going to face is for the positions of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff.
    As far as managers are concerned, only two managers are going to retire. HR department
    has to offer an intensive training to junior staff so that they can take responsibility for Senior jobs.
    Also, we recommend that HR should consider hiring back some retired employees as Consultants where there 
    will be shortage of skills.
